# Leetcode Solutions

## Description
A way of challenging myself to complete leetcode solutions once a day. In an attempt to motivate myself to complete smaller coding tasks alongside my University work, I have decided to challenge myself to complete one leetcode solution until the end of this year. That is, from the 14/11/2023, 48 days. By the end of this project, there should be 48 completed leetcode questions in the repository.

## Status
This project's current status is: early development.
